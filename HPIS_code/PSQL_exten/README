3. reload work_mem
4. Copy the orion front code and experiment script. Install the new functions
* 5. Modify the script for the experiment specific purpose. 
6. Run the clear buffer script and Start running experiment script

Some notes:

chunks is printed out even if "analyze" command is not provided

2. The orion_front.py and custom function code are modified to add support for sgd.
